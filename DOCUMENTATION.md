## TO START

This project started as a very fun and interesting one that should already have a place in my portfolio. BUT as soon as i try to add more and more to it and the deadline gets closer and closer all good things must come to an end. If i factor in the countless bugs it turns into a nightmare :')

## THOUGHT PROCESS

My first concern was to have the minimum requirements and try and build onto them as much as i could. The timeline is the following:

    - Handle the fetch request  
    - Add favorites list(add/remove)
    - Save favorites to local storage
    - New page for each clicked movie
    - Error page 
    - Handle fetch pagination, add footer
    - Add more styling and animations
    - Deploy in Github 

## ISSUES

I am not familliar with the UI library nor had time to look it up. The same goes with the Angular framework.

The biggest issue was with deployment. Some errors that didn't pop up localy, poped when i deployed my app on GitHub pages and had to figure them out. They where the methods that where trying to execute on a variable that was not an array because no data was added to it. Those arrays where the favorite movie and the fetched movie arrays. 

One more issue is the sticky position of the 2 headers and the footer that doesn't work on touch screens. It works only when scrolling.

## SHORT ON TIME

    - Fix the styling 
    - Fix responsiveness 
    - Add more error handling
    - Add a few more animations
    - Add the previous viewed feature

## CONCLUSION

Will definetely work more on this project, to add more to it and fix bugs that i haven't seen yet.
